An ASCII bingo board generator in Python

Originally written to build boards for buzzword bingo, but figured it had other uses as well.

Usage:
bingo.py -f [File with list of words] [-w [Cell Width]]

If the -f flag is used with no arguments, it will assume the default path of ./bingo.list

If no -w flag is used, it will assume a default width of 9 characters/cell
